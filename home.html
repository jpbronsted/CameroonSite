  <h1>Ambazonian Genocide Watch</h1>
  <p>The Cameroonian government which continues to oppose and oppress the Ambazonians currently prohibits the documentation of the atrocities it commits. Often, government agents randomly confiscate and examine peopleâ€™s electronic devices to find and punish those who protest online. Additionally, the government continues to restrict Internet access in Ambazonia to limit the visibility of the ongoing conflict from outside the region.</p>

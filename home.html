          <h1> Ambazonian Genocide Watch</h1>
          <p> The Cameroonian government has begun a massive campaign to oppress the Ambazonians via mass genocide and torture. The government further prohibits the documentation of the atrocities it commits, preventing the world from discovering the disasters the Ambazonians are facing every day. The censorship government has enforced has become so extreme that government agents randomly confiscate and examine peopleâ€™s electronic devices to find and punish those who protest online. Additionally, the government continues to restrict Internet access in Ambazonia to limit the visibility of the ongoing conflict from outside the region.</p>
          <h3> The Ambazonians cannot and will not stay silenced. </h3>
          <h5> This website is a collection of video, visual, and auditory recordings of the genocide that Ambazonians have sent in so the world can know and learn of what has occurred in the once beautiful nation of Ambazonia.</h5>

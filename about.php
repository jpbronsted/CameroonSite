            <h1> Ambazonian Genocide Watch</h1>
            <p>In 100 days, the Hutu government of Rwanda slaughtered 800.000
            Tutsis under the watchful eye of President Bill Clinton and
            Secretary General of the United Nations, Koffi Anan. In March 1998,
            President Bill Clinton issued the 'Never Again' apology, in which
            he proclaimed, 'Never Again' shall the world standby and witness
            genocide!!</p>
            <p>Since November 2016, there is an ongoing Genocide on the people
            of Southern Cameroons by Paul Biya, the brutal dictator of La
            Republique du Cameroun, under the watchful eye and appreciation of
            Mr. Antonio Guteress, Secretary General of the United Nations.</p>
            <p>The goal of this website is to systematically document these
            atrocities committed by soldiers of the brutal dictator of La
            Republique du Cameroun and raise awareness in the world on the
            current Genocide on the people of Southern Cameroons/Ambazonia.</p>
            <p>Our hope is that the world shall not yet again, be Bystanders to
            Genocide. We hope people of goodwill across the world will stand up
            and say loudly - 'Never Again' - and take robust action against
            this brutal dictator of La Republique du Cameroun who has murdered
            over 10,000 innocent civilians merely for being Southern
            Cameroonians/Ambazonians.</p>
            <p>We appeal to the consciences of the good people of the world to
            call on world governments and the United Nations to STOP THIS
            GENOCIDE.</p>
            <h2> The Ambazonians cannot and will not stay silenced. </h2>
            <h5> This website is a collection of video, visual, and auditory 
            recordings of the genocide that Ambazonians have sent in so the 
            world can know and learn of what has occurred in the once 
            beautiful nation of Ambazonia.</h5>
